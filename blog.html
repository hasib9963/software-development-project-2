                    <span class="font-bold">var</span> 
                    
                    In JavaScript, the scope of a variable refers to the portion of the program where the variable is accessible. There are two main types of scope in JavaScript: global scope and local scope.
                    Global Scope: Variables declared outside of any function have global scope. This means that they can be accessed from anywhere in the program.
                    Local Scope: Variables declared inside of a function have local scope. This means that they can only be accessed from within that function.
                    <br>
                    <span class="font-bold">let Scope:</span> 
            
                    The let keyword in JavaScript was introduced in 2015 with ES6. It is used to declare block-scoped variables. This means that variables declared with let are only accessible within the block where they are declared. This differs from variables declared with var, which are function-scoped and can be accessed from anywhere within the function in which they are declared.
                    The syntax for declaring a variable with let is as follows:
                    let variableName [= initialValue];
                    <br>
                    <span class="font-bold">const Scope:</span> 
                    
                    In JavaScript, the const keyword is used to declare variables that cannot be reassigned. This means that once a variable is declared with const, its value cannot be changed. Variables declared with const also have block scope, similar to variables declared with let.
                    The syntax for declaring a variable with const is as follows:
                    const variableName = initialValue;
                    
                    In summary, var has function scope with hoisting, let has block scope without hoisting, and const has block scope and is used for declaring constants that cannot be reassigned. These scope distinctions are crucial for writing predictable and maintainable JavaScript code.</p>

                   <span class="font-bold"> null:</span>  
                   The null value in JavaScript has several use cases, including: <br>
                   Representing the absence of a value, Initializing variables, Returning values from functions, Checking for null values, Representing missing values in data analysis
                   <br>
                    <span class="font-bold">undefined:</span>
                    The undefiend value in javascripts has several use cases, including:
                    <br>
                    Uninitialized Variables, Method or Statement Returns, Function Returns, Checking for Absence of Values, Debugging and Error Handling</p>

REST APIs are based on the HTTP protocol and use standard HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to manipulate data.</p>
